I, Nicolina Artz, grew up in the small town of Westmoreland, and spent my entire education at the Westmoreland Central School District. Growing up, I swam competitively for nearly 10 years, until I found a job as a Lifeguard and Swim Instructor, which I am still currently employed as. I enjoy hanging out with friends, discovering new activities/places/people, drawing, listening to music, and more. Iâ€™m excited for the years ahead at RIT: being in a different environment, meeting new friends, learning important things, overall developing myself, etc.
